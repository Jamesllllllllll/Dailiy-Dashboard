1. Clone the original repository directly to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/Jamesllllllllll/Daily-Dashboard.git

2. Create a new branch in your local repository where you will make your changes.

git checkout -b <feature_branch>

3. Pull from development branch from origin

git pull --rebase origin development

4. Make the necessary changes to the codebase in your local branch.

5. Commit and push your changes to the original repository using the branch you created.

git add <file_name>

git commit -m "<commit_message>"

git push origin <feature_branch>

6. Open a pull request within the original repository to propose merging your branch into the main branch or another target branch.

Now collaborators can review your changes, provide feedback, and merge them into the main codebase if approved.
